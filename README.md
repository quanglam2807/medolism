medolism
========

Medolism is a manga/comic sharing social network. It's my project but now it's discontinued. It has features like: account system (create, login, change infomation, change avatar,...), publish manga, read manga, rating,.... It supports multi-language but I use Vietnamese as its default language.

Medolism requires PHP and mySQL to run.
Following these steps to install Medolism:
  1. Copy all the sources to where you want to install.
  2. Import sql/2012-07-06_09-34-00.sql to a MySQL database.
  3. Edit includes/config.php with your MySQL database information.

And it's done and then you can anything you want to fit your needs.
