Medolism
========

***I started this project when I was 14 years old without any frameworks or direct instructions. In 2014, I won the 2nd Prize in Creative Software - Vietnam's National Youth Computing Competition & the 1st Prize in Creative Software - Cantho's Provincial Youth Computing Competition by developing this app.***

***It was poorly coded, unmaintable so do not use it in production. I left it here on GitHub for archiving.***

***In 2017, I tried to reorganize the code and upgrade from PHP 5 to PHP 7. But it seemed like a worthless work.***

Medolism is a manga/comic sharing social network. It has many features, including an account system (to create, login, update profile, etc); publishing, reading & rating manga & many others. It supports multilingual UI but I use Vietnamese as the default language.

Medolism requires PHP and mySQL to run.

Following these steps to install Medolism:
  1. Copy all the sources to where you want to install.
  2. Import sql/2012-07-06_09-34-00.sql to a MySQL database.
  3. Edit includes/config.php with your MySQL database information.

And it's done and then you can anything you want to fit your needs.
